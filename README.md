Camera Cart is a filmmaking robot. It is a cart powered by stepper motors and it is allows users to drive the camera cart through a room, and then have the camera cart remember the path that it travelled and for that path to be played back. Allowing for very steady and repeatable footage which will opens up the door for many different kinds of VFX shots.

  Camera Cart prototype v1
</p>

The First Prototype of the Camera Cart is currently built using TMC2209 motor drivers and Nema 17 stepper motors. The entire camera robot is controlled from commands sent from my computer, and the my computer keeps track of the commands sent over to the computer to resend those instructions to the robot allowing the robot to repeat any path it has already completed.
