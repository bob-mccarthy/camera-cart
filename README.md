Camera Cart is a filmmaking robot. It is a cart powered by stepper motors and it is allows users to drive the camera cart through a room, and then have the camera cart remember the path that it travelled and for that path to be played back. Allowing for very steady and repeatable footage which will opens up the door for many different kinds of VFX shots.
